 ------------------
 Graph input
 ------------------
The first line should include 2 integers, the first one being the number of vertices, and the second being the number of edges. Each following line should define each edge in integers as follows: node1 node2 weight
  ------------------
 Commands
 ------------------
S – Stops the program
R – Reads in the graph
W – Displays the graph
F n1 n2 iFlag – n1 and n2 are integers representing the nodes to compute the shortest path, iFlag can either be 1 to display the length of the path, or 0 to display the path itself.
  ------------------
 About and Restrictions
  ------------------
It stores the graph as a min heap and creates the shortest path using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm. 
It cannot use graphs with negative values.
